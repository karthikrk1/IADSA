Group 05
Short Project - 2
Version 1.0

This folder contains 5 sub folders each, for the 5 problems under Short Project 2.

The folders are named SP2[A..E].

Contents of SP2[A..E] folders:

- Each SP2* folder contains the source "*.java" file for each of the problem.

Notes:

We had to make some changes to the existing Graph, Edge and Vertex classes and hence, we have attached them separately in each
of the folders for convenience. 

In SP2A, SP2B and SP2C, we have modified the Graph class as per our needs.

In SP2D, we have added a new Bipartite class to check for odd length cycle in non bipartite graph.

In SP2E, we have added "int cno" to the Vertex class have the count of connected components, for checking if graph is Eulerian. Class CheckEulerian contains the methods to check for Eulerian conditions.
