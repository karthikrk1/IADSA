# IADSA
The repository for projects under implementation of advanced data structures and algorithms 

There are several short and long projects implemented. 

Short Project 0:

This is a simple project that does an empirical comparison of two O(nlogn) algorithms: namely Merge Sort and Heap Sort (using Java's Priority Queue)
The following results were obtained. - Merge Sort's running time is better than Heap sort as input size grows. The experiment was tested for large inputs (> 1 million) and time was calculated for Heap Sort and Merge Sort. 

Source File: Sort.java

Short Project 1:
This contains a series of projects, that will be implemented. Work in progress!!!
